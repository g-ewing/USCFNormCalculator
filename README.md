# USCFNormCalculator

The United States Chess Federation (USCF) offers titles for players. These titles are earned by achieving strong results in individual tournaments. A qualifying result for a given level is called a "norm" for that level. Since tournament results are generally published quickly after the conclusion of the tournament (the majority of which take place on weekends) and norm results are not published until the subsequent Wednesday, players may wonder whether they achieved a norm. This calculator is intended to tell them that.
